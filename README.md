# Real-or-Fake

In this project I take data from Kaggle of real and fake job postings. 

I clean the data up and use a CountVectorizer to convert the collection of text to a matrix of token counts. I then visualize the token counts to better understand the data.

After exploring the data I build a model using Naive Bayes classification to predict whether a job posting is real or fake. I then test the model to see how well it performs.
